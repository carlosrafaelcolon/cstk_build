<h1>Mission Statement</h1>
<div class="content">
    <p>The Center for the Study of Targeted Killing at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth seeks to document all cases of cross-border counterterror operations including targeted killings, capture operations, and other forms of aggression committed by states against non-state actors that occur outside of armed conflicts.</p>
    <p>The CSTK Database is currently exploring the casualties inflicted by cross border incidents executed by Columbia, Israel, Russia, Turkey, and the United States analyzing news reports from both international and local news sources. We have begun with an analysis of US drone strikes in Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia, and are currently investigating operations launched by the aforementioned states back to the turn of the Twenty-First Century, with plans to expand this research to the middle of the Twentieth Century.</p>

<h1>History</h1>
<div class="content">
    <p>The Center for the Study of Targeted Killing succeeds the UMass Drone Project. Created in 2010 by Matthew S. Fricker, Avery Plaw and Brian Glyn Williams, the UMass Drone project began as a venue for an independent database tracking deaths resulting from drone strikes in Pakistan. Early research based on this database has culminated in several publications including <em>Tracking the Predators: Evaluating the CIA Predator Drone Campaign in Pakistan</em>, <em>Practice Makes Perfect: The Changing Civilian Toll of CIA Drone Strikes in Pakistan</em> and <em>New Light on the Accuracy of the CIAâ€™s Predator Drone Campaign in Pakistan</em>. Carlos R. Colon joined the team in 2012 and helped expand the scope of the UMass Drone project to also track the covert drone war in Yemen and Somalia. In 2014 the project expanded even further to track all cases of crossborder incidents against none-state actors and was renamed the Center for the Study of Targeted Killing.</p>
